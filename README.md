# About Me 🕶


**pberry725c/pberry725c** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on entering the world of data analytics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to create a portfolio of what I've learned and how to get that portfolio in front of people who might want to hire me. 
- 💬 Ask me about where I've been and where I want to go. Or elephants, I can talk for a long time about elephants. 🐘
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me please.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Elephants actually walk on their "tip-toes," it's how their feet are structured and this actually makes them very quiet and not loud at all.
