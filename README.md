# About Me 🕶


- 🔭 I’m new to the world of data analytics, but excited about all the different ways one can engage with the field. 
- 🌱 I'm learning how to code in different languages. I was introduced to html in high school and am currently learning Python. Next, I'd like to make sure I know R as well. 
- 💬 Ask me about elephants, I can talk for a long time about elephants. 🐘
- 📫 How to reach me: Email me please.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Elephants actually walk on their "tip-toes," it's how their feet are structured and this actually makes them very quiet and not loud at all.
